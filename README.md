# Celebration Script

Just to celebrate with your friend,
when they run this script,
a window pops up prompting them for the correct password,
a failed attempt will result doubling the amount of windows, so better
enter the correct password before crashing your enter computer!

And if a correct password is entered, a tiny celebration window will appear saying
congrats, you bagged the job!
